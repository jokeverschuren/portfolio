				<h2>This is me.</h2>
				<p>As peolpe may know I am addicted to shopping in general. I used to buy every week something new. I have a weakness for expensive clothing and shoes. At the moment I have 2 closets and 53 pairs of shoes. A little to much you think? Take a closer look in my closet, it's heaven...
				"I'm just showing my personality in my clothing."</p>
